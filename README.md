# Epidemic simulation

This is a Java project simulating epidemic spread of multiple diseases. The files _main.java_, _GUI1.java_, _GUI2.java_, and the folder _icons_ need to be located in the same directory. _main.java_ can be launched using any up-to-date Java environment. Provided graphical user interfaces are intuitive and self-explanatory, the user will not need any additional instructions on how to use this programme.
